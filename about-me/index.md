I am Frank Zalkow, a Senior Scientist at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/), where I work on research and development of text-to-speech synthesis models. I received my Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing.) in 2021 from [Friedrich–Alexander University Erlangen–Nürnberg (FAU)](https://www.fau.de/) for work in semantic music processing and content-based music retrieval. I am interested in deep learning for music and speech, with a focus on applied research and deployment, taking ideas from early prototypes to innovative products.

## Education

I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Music Informatics and Musicology in 2012 from the [University of Music Karlsruhe](https://www.hfm-karlsruhe.de/), followed by a Master’s degree in Music Informatics in 2015 at the same institution. In 2021, I completed my Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing.) at FAU Erlangen–Nürnberg with the thesis “Learning Audio Representations for Cross-Version Retrieval of Western Classical Music.”

* **Doctoral Thesis**: *Learning Audio Representations for Cross-Version Retrieval of Western Classical Music* ([Download](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bvb:29-opus4-167774), 8.1 MB), Friedrich–Alexander University Erlangen–Nürnberg, 2021.

* **Master Thesis**: *Automated musical style analysis – Computational exploration of the bass guitar play of Jaco Pastorius on symbolic level* ([Download](/media/zalkow_automated_musical_style_analysis.pdf), 3.6 MB), University of Music Karlsruhe, 2015.

## Career

From 2008 to 2015, I worked at the [Max-Reger-Institute Karlsruhe](https://www.max-reger-institut.de/), including contributions from 2010 to 2015 to the Edition of Reger Works (Hybrid Edition) and homepage design from 2013 to 2015. In 2009, at the Institute for Music and Acoustics, [ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe](https://zkm.de), I contributed to the electronic music production for the premiere of Karlheinz Stockhausen’s [“Strahlen” (“Rays”) for a percussionist and 10-track tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strahlen), and from 2010 to 2013 I worked there on digitization and archival projects.

From the winter term 2013/14 to the summer term 2015, I held lectureships at the [Institute of Musicology and Music Informatics](https://www.hfm-karlsruhe.de/hochschule/institute/institut-fuer-musikinformatik-und-musikwissenschaft) at the University of Music Karlsruhe . From October 2015 to July 2016, I was a research fellow at the [Institute of Musicology](http://www.uni-saarland.de/fachrichtung/musikwissenschaft.html), Saarland University, within the DFG project “Computer-aided analysis of harmonic structures” . From August 2016 to July 2021, I was a research fellow at the [International Audio Laboratories Erlangen](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/). I joined Fraunhofer IIS in August 2021 as a post-doctoral researcher and have been a Senior Scientist since December 2022. In this capacity, I was heavily involved in the development and deployment of [Allinga TTS](https://allinga.lze-innovation.de/?lang=en), a text-to-speech system offered as a SaaS.
