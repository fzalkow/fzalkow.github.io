Though Common Lisp is considered an important AI language, I know no open source machine learning library. [CLML](http://cl-www.msi.co.jp/solutions/knowledge/lisp-world/products/CLML-en.html) seems to be extensive, but you'll get the source only against payment. Therefore I wrote a small library for machine learning and published it on [GitHub](https://github.com/fzalkow/cl-mlep). All details, usage examples and an API is to be found on its [project page](http://fzalkow.github.io/cl-mlep/).
